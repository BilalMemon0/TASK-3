    <P class="para2">A young man from Lahore, Mr. Azhar Hussian Siddiqui, 
        took up a job as a shoe salesman in Lahore’s famous Anarkali bazaar.
         His hard work and honesty gained him popularity amongst his team and other salesmen.
          His good reputation earned him job opportunities at other stores, but being a visionary,
           Mr. Siddiqui started his own business in 1974 under the name of Bano Chapal with Rs. 174 only.
            His sincere commitment to his work started paying off and the vision gradually turned into a success story.
